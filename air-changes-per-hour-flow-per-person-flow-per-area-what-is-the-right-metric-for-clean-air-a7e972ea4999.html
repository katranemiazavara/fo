<p>Measuring the amount of clean air begins with determining a clean air delivery rate (CADR) or non-infectious air delivery rate (NADR). Clean air is defined as air that is free from pollutants, and in the case of portable HEPA filters, these pollutants are particulate matter such as dust and airborne viruses and bacteria. To protect against airborne diseases, the NADR is what is important, which refers to air that either has no pathogens or has been disinfected so that any pathogens present are not infectious.</p>
<p>The CADR or NADR are measured in the rate of airflow. Common units used are cubic feet per minute (CFM), meters cubed per hour (m^3 /h) or litres per second (lps),</p>
<p>The danger of any airborne pollutant is related to the inhaled dose, which is directly correlated with the concentration of the pollutant in the air and the length of time spent inhaling it. The concentration of pollutants is influenced by the rate at which they are generated and removed. By increasing the rate at which pollutants are removed, either through ventilation, filtration or UV light, the concentration in the air is reduced, and the inhaled dose is decreased. If the pollutant is an infectious disease, reducing the inhaled dose will lower the risk of infection.</p>
<p>The question then becomes, what CADR is required to reduce the concentration of airborne contaminants to acceptable levels? Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as different contaminants and spaces require different levels of clean air. For example, smells from body odor can be removed through ventilation by supplying outdoor air and exhausting the air in the space. As the number of people in a space increases, higher ventilation levels are necessary to ensure that the air is free from unpleasant smells. Places where people sweat, such as gyms, would require a much higher rate of ventilation than places where people are sitting quietly, such as libraries.</p>
<p>Before we can determine what levels are needed, we need to determine what metrics to use.</p>
<h1>Air Changes per Hour (ACH) — Airflow per Room Volume</h1>
<p>ACH is a commonly used metric and is found in building codes for medical settings. It measures how often the air is changed in the room every hour, so if the room was 100 m³ and you were running a HEPA filter with a CADR of 600 m³/hour, then it would give you 6 air changes per hour. The formula is:</p>
<p>ACH = CADR/volume of the room * unit conversions</p>
<p>In the US, <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/standards-and-guidelines" class="af nc">ASHRAE 170</a> specifies how many ACH is required for different healthcare spaces. For example, the emergency department waiting area requires 3 ACH of outdoor air and 12 total ACH which includes filtered air (see table 7–1 on page 14).</p>
<p>ACH has a few advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="d208">it is easy for people to understand and calculate</span></li>
<li><span id="1202">has a precedent for use in the building code and specifically in medical settings for prevention of airborne disease transmission</span></li>
<li><span id="4f6d">simple values for general guidance. OSPE, Lancet and Harvard Healthy Buildings recommend 6 ACH for general spaces.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>OSPE core recommendations for mitigation of airborne disease transmission and ventilation. Full reports can be found <a href="https://ospe.on.ca/indoor-air-quality/" class="af nc">here</a>.</p>
<p>Guidance from Harvard Healthy buildings found <a href="https://schools.forhealth.org/risk-reduction-strategies-for-reopening-schools/healthy-buildings/" class="af nc">here</a>.</p>
<p>The issue with ACH is that it lacks a basis in physics. To ensure a safe space, you need to customize the CADR to the rate of pollutant generation. The higher the pollutant generation rate, the more clean air you need to deliver. ACH is a measure of flow per volume of the room. There are no pollutants that increase as the volume of the room increases, so using ACH as a basis makes no sense.</p>
<p>An example where ACH is clearly incorrect is when addressing ceiling height. To maintain a constant ACH, you would need to increase flow as the ceiling height increases. However, the risk of airborne disease transmission decreases with high ceilings and increases with low ceilings. It’s safer to be in a place with high ceilings.</p>
<p>For instance, consider two identical rooms. One is a typical commercial space with 2.7 m high ceilings and 6 ACH of non-infectious air. The other has twice the ceiling height at 5.4 m high. If risk was related to ACH, then to achieve the same risk in both places, the second room would require twice the NADR to achieve the same ACH. However, this is not the case. Even if the airflow is the same, the second room, with 3 ACH (same flow but double the volume), would still be less risky since the pollutant generation rate would be identical, but it would dilute faster in large spaces. Other factors that can help in larger spaces include transient time, decay, and deposition rates which are explained <a href="http://portfolio.cpl.co.uk/CIBSE/202106/42/" class="af nc">here</a>.</p>
<p>In smaller spaces such as cars, airplanes, busses, or single-person offices, 6 ACH might be inadequate for mitigating transmission between two people. In larger spaces with high ceilings, 6 ACH may be excessive. While ACH can be applied in medical settings where the space sizes are standardized, it’s generally not the right metric to use.</p>
<p>One approach to addressing this is to calculate ACH by limiting the ceiling height to 2.7 m. This way, extra airflow isn’t necessary with high ceilings. However, this simply converts the value from airflow per volume of the room to airflow per area of the room.</p>
<p>The one case where air changes per hour applies is calculating the reduction of a pollutant once the room is empty. The formula is:<br />
% reduction = 1-e^-(air changes)<br />
So if everyone has left a room, and the room has 4 air changes per hour of clean air, then after 30 minutes (0.5 hours): air changes = 4 ACH * 0.5 = 2<br />
% reduction in viruses = 1-e^-2 = 86%.</p>
<h1>Airflow per Area of the Room</h1>
<p>If your target is 6 air changes per hour and you assume 2.7 m high ceilings, then CADR = 6 ACH * volume of the room = 6 * area of the room *2.7 m.</p>
<p>CADR/Area = 16.2 m³/h /m²<br />
In imperial units, CADR/Area = 0.9 CFM/ft²</p>
<p>Guidance for the correct airflow rate can be used in flow per area instead of flow per volume. The numbers do not round as nicely as with ACH, but you can easily convert between them by dividing by the ceiling height of 2.7 m. This metric is more accurate than ACH since it avoids the problem of higher ceilings. ASHRAE was considering using this metric as guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it never came to fruition.</p>
<p>Airflow per area still has one significant disadvantage. Not all spaces are used the same. Some spaces have very high occupant density, and some places have low occupant density. Using airflow per area assumes that the risk in these two spaces is equal since the only factor with this metric is the area and not the amount of people, but this is incorrect. The more people, the higher the risk. So perhaps the correct metric has nothing to do with the properties of the space and just how many people there are.</p>
<h1>Airflow per Person</h1>
<p>We are slowly making our way through metrics that make more sense. When you double the amount of people, any pollutants that come from people are likely to double, so you would want double the flow. That is why airflow per person makes a lot of sense. You can convert between airflow per person and airflow per area by knowing the occupant density of the space. ASHRAE 62.1 gives you the expected occupant density of each space.</p>
<p>For example, an elementary school classroom has a density of 25 people per 100 m², or 0.25 people/m². If your airflow per area is 16.2 m³/h /m² and have 1 person every 4 m², then your flow per person is 65 m³/h/person or 18 liters/second/person (lps/person).</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1333991/retrieve" class="af nc">WHO guidance</a> recommends 10 lps/person as a ventilation rate for COVID. (see pages 11 &amp;12)</p>
<p>Airflow per person is the correct metric for pollutants that come from all people, like CO2 or body odors. However, airborne diseases only originate from infectious people, and it is impossible to know how many infectious people there are. Therefore, it is reasonable to adjust the NADR as the number of people in the space increases.</p>
<p>When it comes to mitigating airborne diseases, a significant problem with flow per person is what is called demand control ventilation (DCV). If you target airflow based on the number of people, and there are very few people there, you would have very little airflow.</p>
<p>Imagine you have two classrooms, each with one infectious person. One classroom has 15 people and 150 lps (liters per second) of clean air, while the other has 30 people and 300 lps of clean air. Both of them have the same airflow per person, but the second room is much lower risk since there is double the total airflow for removal, even though they have the same amount of infectious air generated. This is why one of the ASHRAE epidemic task force recommendations was to remove demand control ventilation during the pandemic.</p>
<h1>Current Building Code Requirements</h1>
<p>Indoor air quality in public spaces is generally managed solely through supplying outdoor air. The outdoor air flow rates required are defined in <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/standards-and-guidelines" class="af nc">ASHRAE standard 62.1</a>. The most current standard is from 2022 and it is revised every few years. Building codes reference a version of these standards, but the ventilation rates have not changed meaningfully in the past 20 years. This standard is not designed to protect occupants from airborne diseases.</p>
<p>ASHRAE 62.1 uses a combination of flow rate per person and flow rate per area. The flow rate per area addresses pollutants from the space, like volatile organic compounds and flow rate per person addresses pollutants from people, like body odors. Demand control ventilation can be used to reduce the airflow when there are fewer people there, but it is limited because there is still the area component.</p>
<p>For example, in a typical elementary school classroom, ASHRAE 62.1 requires 10 CFM/person and 0.12 CFM/ft². For a 800 ft² classroom with 25 people, the required outdoor airflow is:<br />
10 CFM/person x 25 people + 0.12 CFM/ft² x 800 ft² = 346 CFM</p>
<p>If only two people are in the same room, the required outdoor airflow is:<br />
10 CFM/person x 2 people + 0.12 CFM/ft² x 800 ft² = 116 CFM</p>
<h1>Airflow per Infectious Aerosol Generation</h1>
<p>When it comes to mitigating transmission of airborne infectious diseases, this is the value that you ultimately care about. In places with no infectious people, there are no infectious aerosols, so there is no flow required to protect anyone from airborne infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Depending on the person and activity, the aerosol generation can change significantly. In these graphs, it compares the infectious aerosol generation when breathing, talking and singing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2022.2140822" class="af nc">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2022.2140822</a></p>
<p>As seen in the graph, there is a very small amount of virus copies when only breathing, so quiet places where people are not talking often, like libraries and movie theaters while the movies are playing, would require a much lower airflow rate to provide the same risk as a place where people are talking.</p>
<p>From the graph on the right, exercising has even higher infectious aerosol generation than singing, talking or breathing. This means that the highest risk places would be indoor gyms and clubs, followed by louder places where people are talking, like bars and restaurants. As infectious aerosol generation rates increase, NADR rates would need to also increase to maintain a reasonably low risk environment. As the number of infectious people in a space climbs, that would also increase the infectious aerosol generation which would increase the required NADR to maintain acceptable risk.</p>
<p>Risk in a classroom can vary depending on the activity. If all the students are sitting quietly at their desks, then risk would be much lower than if there was an activity occurring with lots of talking and moving around. The latter case would require a higher NADR to maintain a low risk environment.</p>
<h1>Short Range Transmission</h1>
<p>A common myth is that indoor air quality and ventilation do not help with short range transmission. This is clearly false as short range transmission is much lower risk outdoors than indoors where the only difference is the air. The question is: what factors contribute to mitigation of short range transmission?</p>
<p>Before answering this, it is important to know why short range transmission is higher risk. Just like smoke is initially concentrated in front of a smoker after exhaling, when an infectious person exhales, the plume of infectious aerosols will initially be more concentrated in front of them at short range and then diffuse into the room where the concentration will be lower. High levels of ventilation will remove those particles, but if you are in a poorly ventilated room for a long period, you will still inhale a high dose, even if you are not at short range.</p>
<p>Outdoors is much lower risk for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><span id="e203">There are no walls or ceilings, so air does not remain trapped in the room. Any infectious aerosols will float away.</span></li>
<li><span id="74c3">Outdoor air speeds are usually much higher than indoor air speeds. High air speed dilutes air in the initial exhaled plume much faster and reduces the inhalation dose at short range. This is also why risk is lower on <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-021-06796-z" class="af nc">windier days</a>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>One significant factor that affects short range transmission is the air quality in the room in general. Even at short range from another person, the majority of air you inhale is not directly from that person, but other air in the room. If the virus concentration is high in the room, risk increases significantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34704625/" class="af nc">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34704625/</a></p>
<p>The other factor is airflow in the space. The better the mixing of the air in the room, the quicker the breathing zone air will get diluted and the lower the inhalation dose.</p>
<p>If a sufficient rate of clean air is supplied to the space and the air speed in the space is sufficient, good air quality can mitigate short range transmission.</p>
<h1>Increasing Air Speed</h1>
<p>Air speed is a comfort issue addressed in ASHRAE Standard 55. If the air speeds in a space are too slow, it feels stuffy. If they are too high, it feels drafty. The allowable air speeds depend on the temperature and activity. For example, gyms are allowed to have high air speeds due to high metabolic activity. One critical allowance is that if the occupants have control, there is no limit on the air speeds and they can adjust it as they like. Since increasing airspeeds in a space can reduce the risk of short range transmission, here are some things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li><span id="16d3">Include a speed controller with a ceiling fan that allows the occupants to increase the air speed in the space. Provide proper training and labelling to tell the occupants to keep it on for their safety.</span></li>
<li><span id="c40f">Use pedestal fans</span></li>
<li><span id="6ee9">Use portable air cleaners since they have fans</span></li>
<li><span id="5427">If the ventilation system is variable volume, increase the airflow supplied to the space.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>When people are sitting in the same place all day, like in an office or classroom, creating a direct air current from one person to another can increase the risk for anyone downwind, so care should be taken not to create direct air currents.</p>
<p>The current advice from <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/covid-19/core-recommendations-for-reducing-airborne-infectious-aerosol-exposure.pdf" class="af nc">ASHRAE</a>, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html" class="af nc">CDC</a> (FAQ 11) and <a href="https://ospe.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Safer_Indoor_Air_Nov22_Final.pdf" class="af nc">OSPE</a> is to use fans to mix the air in the space better provided it is not a room with directional airflow and you do not create a direct current between people. In addition to increasing air speeds, better mixed air in the space ensures the clean air is properly distributed throughout the space.</p>
<p>All this will help mitigate short range transmission, but to properly create a low risk space, air cleaning is required through ventilation, filtration or UV.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ef3652ab722df11fcb2ba5d/t/637740d40f35a9699a7fb05f/1668759764821/Lancet+Covid+Commission+TF+Report+Nov+2022.pdf" class="af nc">Lancet COVID-19 Commission</a> released proposed NADR and used all the metrics — air changes per hour, flow per area and flow per person.</p>
<p>As discussed, converting between different metrics requires making assumptions about ceiling height and occupant density. These values provide a good general basis for clean air targets, but a gym or club would require much higher airflow rates than a library to achieve the same risk.</p>
