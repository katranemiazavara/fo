<h1>What is CO2?</h1>
<p>CO2, or carbon dioxide, is a gas that naturally occurs in the air. Measuring CO2 can help assess indoor air quality. The concentration of CO2 outdoors is typically around 420 parts per million (ppm) or 0.042%, but has been climbing over the decades as we burn fossil fuels. When people exhale, the concentration of CO2 in the exhaled air is about 40000 ppm or 4%. If a space is not adequately ventilated, the CO2 levels can increase, indicating that people are rebreathing air that has been previously exhaled (gaseous backwash).</p>

<p>While CO2 is generally harmless in normal indoor quantities, elevated levels of CO2 can indicate poor indoor air quality, which can negatively affect human health and cognitive performance. Understanding CO2 levels can help us gauge the risk of airborne disease transmission and ensure adequate ventilation to maintain a healthy indoor environment.</p>
<h1>What values are safe?</h1>
<p>CO2 can be used in two ways to assess indoor air quality: as a proxy for ventilation or as a direct measurement of CO2 exposure. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists sets threshold limit values (TLVs) for CO2 exposure to ensure safe levels of the gas in the air. The <a href="https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/chem_profiles/carbon_dioxide.html#section-10-hdr" class="af ny">TLV for CO2</a> is 5000 ppm for an 8-hour average and 30000 ppm for short-term exposure. However, it’s important to note that safe CO2 levels only relate to the direct exposure to CO2 and do not imply acceptable indoor air quality. Good ventilation levels are typically below 1000 ppm, whereas poorly ventilated areas can range between 1000–3000 ppm. In most circumstances, there is low concern about exceeding CO2 TLVs.</p>
<h1>What is an acceptable CO2 level for indoor environments?</h1>
<p>Since CO2 concentration is a measure of the balance between its generation and removal, an alternative question is: what is an acceptable outdoor airflow rate? Outdoor airflow rates are not designed to mitigate airborne disease transmission, but to ensure overall comfort for most occupants and are found in ventilation standards. By answering this question, you can calculate the expected CO2 level in a building that complies with the required outdoor airflow rate. The Ontario Society of Professional Engineers has developed a helpful calculator to estimate the expected CO2 levels in indoor spaces that meet the current ventilation standards: <a href="http://ospe-calc.herokuapp.com/" class="af ny">http://ospe-calc.herokuapp.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some typical CO2 levels reported in <a href="https://ospe.on.ca/indoor-air-quality/" class="af ny">OSPE’s indoor air quality reports</a> for different settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="7fd8">Daycare centers: 850 ppm</span></li>
<li><span id="3455">Elementary school classrooms: 900 ppm</span></li>
<li><span id="5a6e">High school classrooms: 1150 ppm</span></li>
<li><span id="e5d9">Offices: 1050 ppm</span></li>
<li><span id="6a99">Retail stores: 1300 ppm</span></li>
<li><span id="14d5">Doctor’s offices: 1000 ppm</span></li>
<li><span id="0212">Dental procedure rooms: 800 ppm</span></li>
</ul>
<p>(Warning: this next part uses math, you can skip it)</p>
<p>To understand where these CO2 values originate, it requires some math and knowledge of engineering standards. There are three steps to determining acceptable CO2 levels inline with current standards:</p>
<p>First, calculate the required outdoor airflow rate based on the ventilation rate procedure (VRP) in <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/standards-and-guidelines" class="af ny">ASHRAE 62.1</a>, which is the standard for North America. The VRP uses two values from Table 6–1: the flow per person and flow per area. These values are used to determine the total outdoor airflow rate in liters per second (lps). For example, suppose you have a typical classroom with 25 people and 85 square meters. Using Table 6–1, the flow per person is 5 lps and the flow per square meter is 0.6 lps. You can then calculate the outdoor airflow rate as follows:<br />
Outdoor airflow rate = (5 lps/person × 25 people) + (0.6 lps/m² × 85 m²)<br />
Outdoor airflow rate = 176 lps<br />
Outdoor airflow rate per person = 176 lps / 25 people<br />
Outdoor airflow rate per person = 7 lps/person</p>
<p>Second, to determine the CO2 generation rate, you can use this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666301/" class="af ny">table</a> that provides CO2 generation based on age, gender, and activity level.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a 15-year-old male student who is sitting and writing in a classroom, his metabolic rate is 1.3 according to the first table. Using the second table, you can determine the corresponding CO2 generation rate, which is between 0.0041 and 0.0048 lps. This equates to around 0.0045 l/s per person.</p>
<p>Finally, once you have the outdoor airflow rate and CO2 generation rate, you can use the following formula to calculate the steady-state indoor CO2 concentration:<br />
Indoor CO2 = Outdoor CO2 + (generation rate × 1 000 000) / outdoor airflow rate</p>
<p>For example, using the values from the previous steps:<br />
Indoor CO2 = 420 ppm + (0.0045 l/s per person × 1,000,000) / 7 lps/person<br />
Indoor CO2 = 1062 ppm</p>
<p>This calculation provides an estimate of the steady-state indoor CO2 concentration. You can use this information to determine whether the indoor CO2 level meets acceptable levels for the space in question.</p>
<p>This is a plot of expected CO2 levels vs outdoor airflow rate per person.</p>
<p>The formula can also be reversed to diagnose outdoor airflow rate based on CO2 levels. For a classroom, if the steady state CO2 concentration is 1200 ppm, then the outdoor airflow rate is:<br />
Outdoor airflow rate =(generation x 1 000 000)/(Indoor CO2 — Outdoor CO2)</p>
<p>= (0.0045 x 1000000)/(1200–420)=5.8 lps/person</p>
<p>This is lower than the minimum requirement in ASHRAE 62.1 and almost half of the 10 lps/person recommended by the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1333991/retrieve" class="af ny">WHO</a>.</p>
<h1>Transient time and temporary readings</h1>
<p>Buildings are not completely airtight, and air can leak in and out through the building envelope, a process known as infiltration and exfiltration. If a room has been unoccupied for some time, the previously exhaled air by occupants would have leaked out of the building, and the CO2 levels in the room should be similar to the outdoor air CO2 levels of around 420 ppm.</p>
<p>As occupants spend more time in the space, the CO2 levels will begin to rise, which is referred to as the transient state. Once the rate at which CO2 is generated matches the rate at which it is removed, it reaches a steady state. In larger rooms, the air volume is greater, and it takes a longer time to reach the steady state, as illustrated in this plot:</p>
<p>A graph showing the transient state and steady state in two rooms. The smaller room (blue line) reaches steady state much quicker than the larger room (red line). The steady state concentration is independent of room size. The yellow area is the reduced concentration of the pollutant people would be exposed to in a larger room. <a href="http://portfolio.cpl.co.uk/CIBSE/202106/42/" class="af ny">http://portfolio.cpl.co.uk/CIBSE/202106/42/</a></p>
<p>However, other factors can temporarily affect the CO2 levels, such as a person breathing near the CO2 sensor, which can show a high CO2 concentration that does not represent the actual air quality of the space. Additionally, when people enter or leave the room, their metabolic rate increases, causing a temporary increase in CO2 levels.</p>
<h1>Assessing risk for COVID and other airborne disease transmission</h1>
<p>To assess the risk of airborne transmission of any pollutant, including infectious aerosols, it’s important to consider the concentration of that pollutant in the air. This concentration is affected by both the rate at which it’s generated and the rate at which it’s removed. When it comes to infectious aerosols and CO2, comparing their generation and removal can help us understand the relationship between them.</p>
<p>Infectious aerosols are generated by infectious people, and the rate of generation depends on the activity level.</p>
<p>Figures showing aerosol generation based on different activities. Exercising (purple), singing (blue), and talking (magenta) have much higher rates than breathing alone (yellow). <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2022.2140822" class="af ny">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2022.2140822</a></p>
<p>CO2, on the other hand, is generated by all people and combustion reactions, and is removed through ventilation or sorbent-based removal systems. Infectious aerosols can be removed by various means, such as ventilation, filtration, UV light, natural decay, or deposition (landing on surfaces).</p>
<p>Here’s how infectious aerosols and CO2 are related:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="468f">CO2 generation increases with more people, and so does the risk of having an infectious person present.</span></li>
<li><span id="114a">CO2 and infectious aerosol generation both increase with higher activity level.</span></li>
<li><span id="5f21">CO2 and infectious aerosol concentration both increase with poor ventilation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are also ways in which CO2 is not related to the risk of airborne disease transmission:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="2e3f">When people are just exhaling and not talking or exercising, infectious aerosol generation can be very low, but CO2 generation can still be at a normal level.</span></li>
<li><span id="93eb">Filtration and UV light can reduce the concentration of infectious aerosols in the air, but they do not affect CO2 levels.</span></li>
<li><span id="b6da">If CO2 is generated from combustion reactions or sublimating dry ice, the CO2 concentration will increase without an increase in infectious aerosol concentration.</span></li>
<li><span id="3523">CO2 can be removed from the air through sorbent-based removal systems, but these systems are not designed to capture particulate matter like infectious aerosols.</span></li>
<li><span id="62c5">Infectious aerosols are only generated by infectious people. If there are no infectious people present, there is no risk of transmission, even if CO2 levels are high.</span></li>
<li><span id="1a1c">In larger rooms, infectious aerosols have a larger volume of air to disperse in, which means they have a longer average travel distance before reaching a susceptible person. This increased travel distance increases the time between emission and inhalation, which allows more time for infectious aerosols to decay or settle out of the air before being inhaled. Therefore, the risk of infection from airborne transmission is generally lower in larger rooms compared to smaller rooms with the same number of people. CO2 does not decay or settle.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/about/position%20documents/pd_indoorcarbondioxide_2022.pdf" class="af ny">ASHRAE’s position</a> is that “all else being equal, higher CO2 concentrations correspond to lower outdoor air ventilation rates and the potential for an increased risk of airborne transmission” while acknowledging many of the limitations stated here.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best use of CO2 monitoring is to ensure that ventilation is functioning properly, as ventilation is the main method used to ensure adequate air quality. Monitoring CO2 levels can be a helpful tool in an overall strategy to ensure a healthy indoor environment.</p>
<h1>What is a good CO2 level?</h1>
<p>According to ASHRAE’s <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/about/position%20documents/pd_indoorcarbondioxide_2022.pdf" class="af ny">position document</a> on indoor air CO2: “An indoor CO2 concentration below 1000 ppm has long been considered an indicator of acceptable IAQ”. This value corresponds to the CO2 levels found in many classrooms and offices according to ASHRAE 62.1 standards. However, this is a general measure of air quality and does not necessarily indicate a low risk of airborne virus transmission. When considering airborne virus transmission, the first step is to determine the recommended non-infectious airflow rates, as outlined by the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ef3652ab722df11fcb2ba5d/t/637740d40f35a9699a7fb05f/1668759764821/Lancet+Covid+Commission+TF+Report+Nov+2022.pdf" class="af ny">Lancet COVID-19 Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming all clean air is supplied through outdoor air, and not through filtration or UV, a ventilation rate of more than 14 lps/person — considered the “best” value — would lead to a CO2 concentration of less than 700 ppm. The “good” value, as recommended by WHO at 10 lps/person, corresponds to a CO2 level of 800 ppm.</p>
<p>As a generalization:</p>
<p>&lt;600 ppm — very good<br />
600–800 ppm — good<br />
800–1000 ppm — adequate<br />
1000–1500 ppm — poor<br />
&gt;1500 ppm — very poor</p>
<h1>Comparing two cases and assessing risk</h1>
<p>When comparing two situations and assessing risk, it’s important to use the correct metric. The metric that matters for airborne virus transmission is infectious aerosol generation versus total airflow. Let’s consider two cases: the first case involves two people, one of whom is infectious, with 15 lps of outdoor air per person and 700 ppm CO2. The second case involves ten people, one of whom is infectious, with 5 lps of outdoor air per person and 1250 ppm CO2.</p>
<p>In the first case, the total airflow is 30 lps, while in the second case, the total airflow is 50 lps. However, since the infectious aerosol generation is the same in both cases, the second case with more people and higher CO2 would still be considered lower risk because the total airflow per infectious person is higher.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that this does not mean 1250 ppm is a low-risk level, but rather that 700 ppm is much higher risk than would be expected in this case. As a general rule of thumb, low CO2 levels should not be used as an indicator of low risk if there are fewer than ten people in a confined space. As the number of people increases, the risk increases due to the higher likelihood of encountering an infectious individual.</p>
<h1>What alternatives are there to CO2 monitoring?</h1>
<p>Although CO2 monitoring is not a perfect method for monitoring ventilation, it is currently the best tool available. Other methods include the building automation system (BAS), airflow monitoring, and air balancing measurements.</p>
<p>The BAS is a computerized system that controls HVAC equipment and can provide information on whether the equipment is operating properly, including how much outdoor air is being supplied to the space and the temperature of the air at different locations in the air handling unit. Here is a typical display of an air handling unit from a BAS:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.veris.com/air-handling-unit-ahu-applications" class="af ny">https://blog.veris.com/air-handling-unit-ahu-applications</a></p>
<p>Airflow stations connected to the BAS can also be used to measure airflow, but they require proper maintenance for dust and can lose accuracy over time. However, these methods do not necessarily provide transparency to occupants or account for issues with air distribution in the space.</p>
<p>Air balancing measurements can be taken by an air balancer, but these measurements may not reflect the actual ventilation rate for occupants under all conditions. Additionally, these measurements are typically taken at one point in time and may not account for changes in equipment or conditions.</p>
<p>One simple method to confirm airflow to the space is to attach a tissue to the diffuser or end of a stick, but this method does not provide an accurate measurement of airflow rate or the proportion of outdoor air to recirculated air. However, one of the most common problems with ventilation is equipment that is not running and this test can notify the occupants immediately when that occurs. It was used in New York to verify ventilation.</p>

<h2>Toilet paper on a stick? It's just one way to test ventilation in NYC schools.</h2>

<p>ny.chalkbeat.org</p>
<p>In comparison, CO2 monitoring in the space is an inexpensive and widely available method that accounts for air distribution and provides an accurate measurement of airflow rate per person. While it is not a perfect method, it is currently the best option for monitoring ventilation.</p>
<h1>How to use a CO2 monitor</h1>
<p>To use a CO2 monitor, it’s recommended to use the most accurate sensor called non dispersive infrared (NDIR). When placing the CO2 monitor, avoid placing it near people, windows, doors or air vents. Instead, it should be placed at a height of 1.5 m on a wall in a location that is representative of the air being inhaled by the occupants. Avoid placing it inside HVAC ducts as it may not represent the same pollutant concentration as the space.</p>
<p>CO2 measurements can be used to quickly gauge how much air is being rebreathed. However, in places where people must be present like schools, offices, healthcare facilities or congregate living settings, steady state CO2 levels can be used to determine if the ventilation is meeting current standards.</p>
