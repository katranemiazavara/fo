<p>Ignore it at your peril. If you don’t design a space with noise in mind, people won’t tolerate it. Noise needs full consideration. The good news is we can design the spaces properly and get the right amount of clean air with acceptable noise. You just need to know how.</p>
<h1>IAQ vs. IEQ</h1>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) is just one of many factors that affect indoor environment quality (IEQ). IEQ comprises many aspects including thermal comfort (air temperature, radiant temperature, drafts), moisture/dampness/mold, lighting, noise &amp; vibrations and IAQ.</p>
<p>Portable air cleaners (PACs), like portable HEPA filters, are a common case where two of these IEQ aspects can work against each other.</p>
<p>IAQ is the tool that helps mitigate the transmission of airborne diseases, so throughout 2020–2022 people were willing to compromise on other parts of IEQ to improve IAQ. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="1ddb">opening windows, even when it gets too cold inside</span></li>
<li><span id="619f">allowing drafts from PACs, fans or windows</span></li>
<li><span id="a1e4">using equipment, like PACs, that create too much noise</span></li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are sustainable solutions. Temperature and noise are also health, safety and productivity issues and cannot be neglected. Improvements in IAQ need to account for IEQ in their design or they are bound to fail.</p>
<h1>Noise Levels — What’s Acceptable?</h1>
<p>The tolerable noise level depends on many factors including the type of space, how it’s used and who is there. Noise is measured in decibels or dB, however, people are not equally sensitive to noises at different frequencies. We are much more sensitive to noises at high frequency and less sensitive at low frequencies, so the dBA scale was created where higher frequency noises are weighted higher to reflect how people hear noise. School regulations for noises are based on <a href="https://successforkidswithhearingloss.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ANSI-ASA_S12.60-2010_PART_1_with_2011_sponsor_page.pdf" class="af oi">ANSI S12.60</a> with background noises required to be below 35 dBA. This is a very low level and not achieved in most places.</p>
<p>Samples of the data measured from 220 K-12 classrooms in five school districts. One-minute unoccupied A-weighted equivalent levels (LAeq) were recorded to characterize the background noise level in the classrooms due to ventilation noise. Ninety-one percent of classrooms do not meet the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) recommended maximum of 35 dB(A). Source: <a href="https://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Building-a-Sound-Future-for-Students-Considering-the-Acoustics-in-Occupied-Active-Classrooms-Laura-C.-Brill.pdf" class="af oi">https://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Building-a-Sound-Future-for-Students-Considering-the-Acoustics-in-Occupied-Active-Classrooms-Laura-C.-Brill.pdf</a></p>
<p>The WHO also <a href="https://speechandhearing.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SAC-OAC-2019-Classroom-Acoustics_EN.pdf" class="af oi">recommends</a> that the noise in an unoccupied classroom be below 35 dBA and that an occupied classroom should remain between 40–50 dBA. <a href="https://cleanairstars.com/filters" class="af oi">Clean Air Stars</a> has the following recommendation, which can serve as a good basis for maximum noise levels:</p>
<h1>Calculating Noise</h1>
<p>The dB scale is logarithmic, so doubling the noise does not double the dB, it increases it by 3. Here are the calculations to compare noise or add/subtract noise. To compare the noise of two devices, the formula is:</p>
<p>Noise ratio = 10^(dB difference/10)<br />
If you have one PAC at 55 dB and another at 47dB, the difference is 8 dB.<br />
Noise ratio = 10^(8/10) = 6.3<br />
The louder one is the equivalent of having more than 6 quieter ones!</p>
<p>To add/subtract the noise from multiple PACs:<br />
dB difference = 10 x log(noise ratio)<br />
So if you have 1 PAC at 50 dB and you want to use 3 of them, the noise ratio = 3.<br />
dB difference = 10 x log 3 = 4.7.<br />
So the final dB = 50+4.7 dB = 54.7 dB</p>
<h1>Selecting PACs with noise in mind</h1>
<p>If you want the right answer, you need to ask the right question. You should see PACs as an air cleaning AND noise making device. The right question is how do you get 250 cubic ft per minute of clean air with only 45 dBA noise? The numbers can change depending on the space, but the basis of the question remains the same.</p>
<p>It seems like an easy solution — pick a quiet PAC. But if you have a look at the PACs on the market, you will quickly notice that almost all of them are too loud. It is extremely rare to find any PAC advertised at being below 45 dBA.</p>
<p>There are 3 main solutions to this:</p>
<h2>1. Embrace the low speed</h2>
<p>Want to know how to play Moneyball with HEPA filters? Don’t look at the specs on high speed. Buy many of them and run them on low speed. As you reduce the speed, the noise efficiency increases — you get more flow at a given noise level. By running many of these units together at low speeds, you can achieve the desired CADR while remaining within your noise limits. Here’s an example on noise, CADR and different speeds from 3 Levoit models:</p>

<p>Let’s say our maximum is 45 dBA (red line). Here are your options with these 3 air cleaners:</p>
<p>Some noticeable patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><span id="451e">You can’t run the 300 or 600 on higher speeds. 400 on the highest speed is just at the maximum noise tolerance and provides the lowest CADR at 45 dBA.</span></li>
<li><span id="319f">Lower speeds have a better CADR/noise ratio. You get the highest CADR by running more on lower speeds</span></li>
<li><span id="93f2">More powerful ones are still more effective on lower speeds than smaller ones</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, buying more of them and buying the more powerful ones would increase cost, but once you know what your goals are, this is the path you need to take. You can then do a cost analysis to see what the best option financially is.</p>
<p>The Taotronics is possibly the most cost-effective HEPA filter on the market, so using the strategy to run multiple ones on a lower speed would work well. Low speed is 42 litres/sec and 32 dBA noise. Second speed is 58 litres/sec and 37 dBA noise. High speed is at 52 dBA, so it’s not worth considering. Here’s what you can get by using many of them on low and medium speed:</p>
<p>Want a clean air delivery rate of 220 litres/sec? You can have 5 run on low speed at 39 dBA or around 4 run on medium speed with 43 dBA. Very high CADR with low noise.</p>
<p>Clean air stars has provided all of the data and recommendations for making this decision: <a href="https://cleanairstars.com/filters" class="af oi">https://cleanairstars.com/filters</a> . The data they have collected for the different PACs and noise levels can be found here: <a href="https://t.co/A8P4rYRw78" class="af oi">https://t.co/A8P4rYRw78</a></p>
<h2>2. The Corsi-Rosenthal Box — use a quieter fan</h2>
<p>CR Boxes are inconsistent with noise profile because they use different fans. Some of the most powerful fans are the noisiest and not appropriate for many situations. The most commonly used box fans are the Utilitech, Lasko and For-Living. The noise usually falls within the range of 47–52 dBA. Areas with higher background noise should be able to tolerate these without difficulty. For a typical classroom, the noise tolerance varies depending on the environment and teacher. An option to reduce the noise is to use the more expensive Honeywell HF-910 fan. It is a bit more difficult to mount since it is a round fan and has higher cost ($90 vs. $40), but the noise is around 45 dBA. Even at the low speed with 45 dBA, it still gives a CADR of more than 270 lps.</p>
<p>There’s another option with the CR boxes which is generally not advisable, but it’s better than leaving them off. There are fan speed controllers which can slow down the fans even more. The problem is once you start doing this, it isn’t clear what the clean air delivery rate is and you might end up slowing it down too much, so this can cause more harm than help. If there was a reliable way to slow them down and to ensure you are getting the desired clean air delivery rate, this would be a good option.</p>
<h2>3. PC Fans</h2>
<p>This might be the future of in-room air cleaners. To clean the air, you need a fan. PC fans are designed to be super quiet, even when you are sitting very close. Using these fans gets the best clean air delivery rate at low noise that you can find. A single fan cannot provide that much flow, but these fans can be placed in parallel to give you very high airflows with very low noise.</p>
<p>People are beginning to DIY PC fan Corsi-Rosenthal boxes, but there are still limited resources online to assist with this (I’m working on it) and these take a lot more effort than the CR Boxes using box fans. They are also considerably more expensive than the box fans. Instead of DIY, you can purchase them at <a href="https://www.cleanairkits.com/" class="af oi">https://www.cleanairkits.com/</a> .</p>
