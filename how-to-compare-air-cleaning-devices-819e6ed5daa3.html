<p><em>Environ. Sci. Technol.</em> 2021, 55, 18, 12172–12179/ <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c02582" class="af lw">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c02582</a></p>
<p>Have you seen a device claim that 99.9% of particles are removed in 30 minutes? Is that better than what a portable HEPA filter could do? What if it said it gives you 40 air changes per hour? How do you compare these?</p>
<p>Often, the data that is given is not sufficient to determine if something is effective. Here is how you would need to determine it.</p>
<p>Content Warning: Math — logarithms and differential equations</p>
<p>Acronyms I’ll be using:<br />
CADR = Clean air delivery rate<br />
CFM = airflow in cubic feet per minute<br />
lps = airflow in liters per second<br />
m³/h = airflow in meters cubed per hour<br />
AC = air changes<br />
eAC = equivalent air changes<br />
ACH = air changes per hour<br />
eACH = equivalent air changes per hour</p>
<h1>Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR)</h1>
<p>Ultimately, this is what you need to know about any device you purchase — the rate at which it can supply clean air. CADR is typically measured in volumetric flow rate, such as cubic feet per minute (CFM), liters per second (lps), or meters cubed per hour (m³/h). This information should be provided by the manufacturer for portable HEPA filters, so you don’t need to perform any additional calculations.</p>
<p>To know if the device will be effective for the space, you need to use a metric like airflow per person. Air changes per hour is often used as well, but all metrics have their limitations. See <a href="air-changes-per-hour-flow-per-person-flow-per-area-what-is-the-right-metric-for-clean-air-a7e972ea4999.html" class="af lw">this post</a> to determine if a certain CADR is sufficient.</p>
<h1>Air Changes per Hour (ACH)</h1>
<p>Air Changes per Hour (ACH) is a measure of how many times the air in a room is replaced with fresh air per hour. ACH is used when the air in a room is replaced (like ventilation), while the equivalent ACH (eACH) is used when the air is disinfected (with UV) instead. Sometimes they are used interchangeably. If a device claims to provide a certain amount of ACH or eACH, this value is only meaningful for the room where the test was conducted. When put in a different room, the ACH can be very different.</p>
<p>To convert from ACH to CADR, you can use the following formula:<br />
ACH = CADR * unit conversions/ volume of the room (EQ-1)</p>
<p>For example, if a room is 30 m³ and the CADR is 50 m³/h, then the ACH would be: ACH = 50 / 30 = 1.7 ACH</p>
<p>If the flow rate units are CFM, then the unit conversion factor is 60 minutes per hour. For instance, if you have a 7200 ft³ classroom and a Corsi-Rosenthal box with a CADR of 500 CFM, then the ACH would be:<br />
ACH = 60 x 500 / 7200 = 4.2 ACH</p>
<p>You can also reverse the formula to calculate CADR if you’re given ACH and room volume to compare the device to a HEPA filter:<br />
CADR = ACH * volume / unit conversion (EQ-2)</p>
<p>For example, if a unit claims to provide 30 ACH and the room volume is 20 m³, then the CADR would be: CADR = 30 x 20= 600 m³/h</p>
<p>As a final example, if you want to find the CADR in CFM for 6 ACH in a 7200 ft³ classroom, the calculation would be:<br />
CADR = 6 * 7200 / 60 = 720 CFM</p>
<p>It’s important to note that if you’re given an ACH without knowing the volume of the room, the value is meaningless. Therefore, it’s crucial to have both pieces of information to accurately calculate CADR.</p>
<h1>% Reduction</h1>
<p>Using the percentage of virus reduced within an hour can be a misleading way to market an air cleaner as the savior of humanity. While this value may seem effective, it can be deceptive and requires careful math to determine the true effectiveness of the device.</p>
<p>The percentage reduction is often used for UV light and electronic air cleaning products because their main goal is to inactivate the virus, rather than providing clean air. However, calculating an equivalent CADR can be challenging. Moreover, the virus naturally decays over time, so those values must be subtracted to obtain an accurate result.</p>
<p>Be wary of any manufacturer that only provides the percentage reduction without disclosing the underlying data or methodology. There are calculators to identify this as shown here or in the <a href="http://ospe-calc.herokuapp.com/Air_Cleaners" class="af lw">OSPE calculator</a>, but I’ll go through the math to explain it.</p>
<p>To calculate the true effectiveness, you need to know how to convert between % reduction and equivalent air changes per hour (eACH).</p>
<p>When cleaning a certain volume of air, the amount of active virus removed is proportional to the concentration of that virus in the air. This can be expressed by the differential equation:<br />
-d(virus removed)/d(volume of air removed) = C x virus concentration</p>
<p>where C is a constant. By solving this equation through integration, you can get:<br />
% virus remaining = e^(- eAC)<br />
Or % virus removed = 1 — e^(-eAC) (EQ-3)</p>
<p>For example, after 7 air changes, the % virus removed is 1 — e^-7 = 99.9%.</p>
<p>To determine the equivalent CADR for an air cleaner, you can rearrange EQ-3:<br />
eAC = -ln(1-% virus removed) (EQ-4)</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say a HEPA filter unit with photocatalytic oxidation has been shown to remove VOCs by 90% after 3 hours in a 640 ft³ room. The eAC:<br />
eAC= -ln(1-%VOC removed) = -ln(1–.9) = 2.3</p>
<p>So this unit provides 2.3 air changes in 3 hours, or 0.77 eACH. To convert this to CADR, we can use EQ-2:</p>
<p>CADR = ACH x volume/unit conversion = 0.77 eACH x 640 ft³ / (60 min/hour) = 8.2 CFM</p>
<p>8.2 CFM is an incredibly low CADR. Minimum requirements in a classroom would be around 350–400 CFM and a CR box provides around 500 CFM. Air leaking into the building (infiltration) would likely be much higher. Therefore, claiming 90% reduction in 3 hours in a tiny room is not particularly effective.</p>
<h1>Subtracting the Control</h1>
<p>Suppose a company selling air cleaning equipment claims that virus concentrations decreased by 99% in one hour with the equipment on and 50% with the equipment off. How effective is the equipment?</p>
<p>Using EQ-4, we can calculate the total equivalent air changes (eAC) as follows:<br />
The total eAC = -ln(1–0.99) = 4.6 eAC<br />
The control eAC = -ln(1–0.5) = 0.7 eAC</p>
<p>As discussed <a href="http://built-envi.com/what-air-cleaner-test-reports-dont-tell-you/" class="af lw">here</a>, we subtract the control eAC from the total eAC to find the contribution of the air cleaner, which is 3.9 eAC.</p>
<p>Sometimes, log reductions are used to report effectiveness, with log 1 reduction indicating 90% removal, log 2 indicating 99% removal, log 3 indicating 99.9% removal and so on. The formula for calculating the percentage of pathogen removed is:</p>
<p>% removed = 1–10^-log reduction (EQ-5)</p>
<p>For instance, if there was a 4.2 log reduction, % removed = 1–10^-4.2 = 99.994%.</p>
<p>Let’s consider an example. An air cleaner claims a 3.3 log reduction of a pathogen in 3 minutes with the equipment on (test) and a 0.8 log reduction in 3 minutes with the equipment off (control). The chamber size is 5.3 ft³. How effective is the air cleaner?</p>
<p>We can first use EQ-5 to calculate the percentage of pathogen removed as follows:<br />
Control: % removed = 1–10^-0.8 = 84%<br />
Test: % removed = 1–10^-3.3 = 99.95%</p>
<p>Next, we can use EQ-4 to convert the percentages to eAC:<br />
Control: eAC = -ln(1–0.84) = 1.8 eAC<br />
Test: eAC = -ln(1–0.9995) = 7.6 eAC</p>
<p>Subtracting the control eAC from the test eAC, we get 7.6–1.8 = 5.8 eAC. Since this happened in 3 minutes, the equivalent air changes per hour (eACH) is 5.8 * 60 min/hour /3 minutes = 116 eACH.</p>
<p>Finally, we can use EQ-2 to convert the eACH into an equivalent clean air delivery rate (CADR):</p>
<p>CADR = eACH * volume / unit conversion = 116 eACH * 5.3 ft³ / 60 = 10.2 CFM. For comparison, a typical CR box has a CADR of around 500 CFM, which is approximately 50 times better.</p>
<p>In summary, removing 99.95% of the pathogen in 3 minutes sounds impressive until we apply the appropriate calculations to understand the air cleaner’s actual effectiveness.</p>
<h1>Full Equation</h1>
<p>Here is the complete equation. If you are given:<br />
V = room volume in ft³<br />
T = time of the test in minutes<br />
Lt = log reduction with the equipment on<br />
Lc = log reduction with the equipment off</p>
<p>CADR (CFM)= V/T * ln(10^(Lt-Lc)) (EQ-6)</p>
<p>For metric units, where volume is in m³ and CADR is in m³/h, the formula is:</p>
<p>CADR=60*V/T * ln(10^(Lt-Lc))(EQ-7)</p>
<p>If you are given:<br />
V = room volume in ft³<br />
T = time of the test in minutes<br />
%t=% removed during test with equipment on<br />
%c= % removed with the equipment off</p>
<p>CADR (CFM) = V/T*(ln(1-%c)/(1-%t)) (EQ-8)</p>
<p>In metric units:<br />
CADR (m³/h)=60*V/T*(ln(1-%c)/(1-%t)) (EQ-9)</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>When given information about log reduction or % of virus removed, you need to know how long it took, the size of the room and the values for the control test. Without that data, it’s meaningless.</p>
<p>A cleaner stated that in one hour, 99.9999% of particles were removed. How is that not effective? There are two math tricks to hide this. The first is that you do not need a high amount of air changes to achieve this — only 14. The second is due to the size of the room in which it was tested. If the room was very tiny, you can have a very high amount of air changes, but once you put that device into a full sized room, it is no longer effective.</p>
<p>As shown in one of the previous tests, the chamber was 5.3 ft³. For comparison, if you place a Corsi-Rosenthal box with 500 CFM there (it wouldn’t fit, but imagine it did), using EQ-1:<br />
ACH = 500 *60/5.3=5660 ACH</p>
<p>To find the amount of virus removed, using EQ-3:<br />
% removed = 1-e^(-ACH) = 1-e^(-5660)<br />
The number is 99.9… with over 2000 9’s afterwards.</p>
<p>So the final conclusions are:</p>
<ol>
<li><span id="8f7c">Do not trust ACH or % reduction data alone. You need to do the math to see what CADR it actually gives to fairly compare it to other air cleaning methods.</span></li>
<li><span id="12e7">Data that does not include the control test, chamber size and the time of the test is not meaningful.</span></li>
<li><span id="1761">Using a small chamber, you can obtain a high ACH or % reduction with equipment that is fairly ineffective in larger rooms.</span></li>
